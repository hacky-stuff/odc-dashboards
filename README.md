# ğŸš§ WIP ğŸš§ ODC dashboards ğŸš§

**Goals:**

P1:

- [ ] Create some cli commands to fetch and sync ("in a smart way") Jira tickets and GitHub issues/PR into a local folder
- [ ] Create a tiny react based webapp that renders tables and charts to understand our status and dependencies

P2:

- [ ] Can we show the tables also in the terminal?

## Setup

```bash
yarn install
```

## CLI

```bash
yarn cli --help

yarn cli github

yarn cli jira list
```
